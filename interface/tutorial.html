            <h2>Use Case</h2>
            <p>This package helps users manage and find songs within large playlists by utilizing a recommendation system. It is particularly useful when you have a playlist with many songs from various genres and want to find specific songs or parts of songs that suit your current mood or preferences.</p>
            <p>Key features include recommendations based on genres, artists, and audio features, as well as playlist management. The package uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for recommendations, which considers genre, popularity, and audio features like danceability, energy, and tempo.</p>
            <p><strong class="important">Note:</strong> Due to limitations in the Spotify API, some genre information may be missing, but the package still provides valuable recommendations based on other available data.</p>

            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <p>To use the Spotify Recommender package, follow these setup steps:</p>

            <h3>Requirements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Network Connection:</strong> Required for retrieving song data from Spotify.</li>
                <li><strong>Patience:</strong> The initial data mapping process can be time-consuming due to multiple API requests per song.</li>
                <li><strong>A fitting playlist (for the playlist features):</strong> Ideal for playlists with 200+ songs from different genres.</li>
                <li><strong>Spotify Access:</strong> Ensure you have access to a Spotify account.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Starting the API</h3>
            <p>To start the API, you need to gather initial information such as the playlist URL and user ID (if applicable). Here’s how the different options work:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Playlist Url:</strong> The URL of the playlist you want to use. You can obtain it by right-clicking the playlist name or selecting the three dots next to the playlist and then clicking share (optional).</li>
                <li><strong>Liked Songs (If the playlist to be used is your "liked songs" playlist):</strong> Set this flag if you want to use your Liked Songs playlist.</li>
                <li><strong>Playlist Id (not recommended):</strong> The unique identifier of the playlist found in the playlist URL.</li>
                <li><strong>User Id (not required, since it's retrieved via Spotify login):</strong> Required only in versions before 5.4.0, this is your Spotify user ID.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Getting the Auth Token</h3>
            <p>When you start the API, a web browser will open for you to log in to your Spotify account and authorize the application. The access token will be cached for 60 minutes. After it expires, re-authentication will be required if the application is still running.</p>
